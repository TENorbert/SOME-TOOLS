## Steps How to do ECALTiming Calibration

## Future Steps will be placed here:
## https://zzz.physics.umn.edu/groups/cms/ecaltime

 - scram list | grep CMSSW_7_0_3_patch2
 - setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc6_amd64_gcc481 or export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc481 
 - scramv1 project -n CMSSW_7_0_3_patch2_TimeCalib2015 CMSSW CMSSW_7_0_3_patch2
 - cd CMSSW_7_0_3_patch2_TimeCalib2015/src
 - cmsenv 
 - eval `scramv1 runtime -csh` or eval `scramv1 runtime -sh`

## Now get the Main Timing calibration package

  - git clone git@github.com:TENorbert/CalibCalorimetry.git

  - scram b -j9

  - cd CalibCalorimetry/EcalTiming/python

 ## Now Make Ntuples by running the command after giving it a prompt-RECO/RECO/AOD input file:

  - cmsRun ecalTimeMakeTree_AOD_cfg.py

## The result is the Ntuple root file called: 
   EcalTimeTree_999999.root
  
## This file can now be Used to Make and Validate Calibration files
## The files showing the calibration constants are .xml files
## while the files showing the Result of the calibration with histograms
## are also root files.

## Creating & Validating Timing Calibration constants is done by the commands:
## after giving the Ntuple "EcalTimeTree_999999.root" as input file

  - cmsRun ecalCreateTimeCalibsAndValidate_cfg.py

## If you just want to create TimeCalibration Constants You do:
  
  - cmsRun ecalCreateTimeCalibrations_cfg.py
 
## The resulting Calibration Constants are .xml files "EcalTimeCalibConstants.xml" and Errors in "EcalTimeCalibErrors.xml" and the overal Offset is "EcalTimeOffset.xml"  while
## the histograms are in the root files "ecalCreateTimeCalibs.root".
## Please take not of the Different classes it is calling at every given stage.
