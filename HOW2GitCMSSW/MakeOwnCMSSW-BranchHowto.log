 ## Steps: Using ECAL Timing Added to Local CMSSW Branch

 cmsrel CMSSW_7_3_2_patch5
 cd CMSSW_7_3_2_patch5
 cmsenv

 git cms-addpkg FWCore/Version
 
 ## Now Add your choice Packages( even Official cmssw Packages you may like to modify and keep in your own branch)

 git cms-addpkg Subsystem/Package
 eg 
 git cms-addpkg CalibCalorimetry/EcalTiming

 ## But since we do not have this is any official cmsrelease we do:
 git clone git@github.com:TENorbert/CalibCalorimetry.git  ## Package for timing Calibration and HardWare Time Adjustment
 git clone git@github.com:TENorbert/ECALTime.git   ## Package for z->22 and Amplitude dependence studies


  ## Now create your own CMSSW Branch

  git checkout -b CMSSW_7_3_2_patch5-ECALTiming2015

  ## Check the current branch in your local repository
  git branch

  ## Now you can make your modifications on all the new packages

  ## Check you git branch status
  git status

  ### Now add all your new/editted branches
  git add --all ./

  ## commit ur changes
  git commit -m "Things of my own cmssw branch"

  ## To Push your branch into your user area of git, First go and fork cmssw software here: 
     https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/fork 

  ## Now push your cmssw release

  git push my-cmssw <ur branchName>
  eg 
  git push my-cmssw CMSSW_7_3_2_patch5-ECALTiming2015

 ## And thats it!!! You can now keep changing things and just committing to your branch.

 ## if you will want to merge your branch back to the official CMSSW Branch
